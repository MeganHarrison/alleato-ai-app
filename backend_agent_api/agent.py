## Recommended Strategy (Priority Order):

### 1. IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (0-2 weeks)
**Quick Wins:**
- Conduct rapid assessment of current state
- Identify and eliminate obvious inefficiencies
- Communicate plan to all stakeholders
- Establish success metrics and tracking

**Risk Mitigation:**
- Document current issues and dependencies
- Create contingency plans for critical paths
- Assign clear ownership and accountability

### 2. SHORT-TERM INITIATIVES (2-8 weeks)
**Process Optimization:**
- Implement lean workflows to reduce waste
- Automate repetitive tasks where possible
- Establish regular checkpoint reviews

**Resource Optimization:**
- Reallocate resources to highest-impact areas
- Consider temporary augmentation for critical gaps
- Build buffer into timeline for unknowns

### 3. MEDIUM-TERM TRANSFORMATIONS (2-6 months)
**Capability Building:**
- Invest in team training and development
- Implement new tools/systems as needed
- Build partnerships to extend capabilities

**Strategic Positioning:**
- Strengthen competitive differentiators
- Expand into adjacent opportunities
- Build pipeline for future growth

### 4. LONG-TERM VISION (6+ months)
**Sustainable Growth:**
- Develop scalable operating model
- Build innovation pipeline
- Create strategic moats

## Implementation Roadmap:

**Week 1-2:** Assessment and planning
**Week 3-4:** Quick wins implementation
**Week 5-8:** Process optimization rollout
**Month 3-4:** Systems and training deployment
**Month 5-6:** Measure, refine, and scale

## Success Metrics:
1. Leading indicators (weekly): Activity completion, issue resolution rate
2. Lagging indicators (monthly): Performance improvement, ROI achieved
3. Strategic indicators (quarterly): Market position, capability maturity

## Key Risk Factors:
- Execution complexity with limited resources
- Stakeholder alignment and change resistance
- External market/competitive dynamics

## Critical Success Factors:
- Executive sponsorship and clear communication
- Dedicated resources with appropriate skills
- Regular monitoring and course correction
- Celebrate wins to maintain momentum
