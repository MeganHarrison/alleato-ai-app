# RAG Pipeline Tasks & Progress

## ðŸŽ¯ RECENT COMPLETION: Meeting Date Enhancement

### âœ… COMPLETED (2024-09-23)
**Enhanced Document Insights with Meeting Date Fields**

**Problem:** Document insights were all created at the same time during batch processing, so RAG couldn't differentiate between insights from recent vs old meetings.

**Solution Implemented:**
- Added `document_date` and `meeting_date` fields to insights
- Enhanced AI prompt to extract actual meeting dates
- Implemented robust date extraction from document titles (multiple formats)
- Updated database conversion to include date fields
- Created comprehensive tests

**Impact:** 
- RAG can now prioritize insights by actual meeting recency
- Better context for time-sensitive queries
- More relevant recommendations based on when meetings occurred

**Files Modified:**
- `insights/enhanced/business_insights_engine.py` - Core implementation
- `MEETING_DATE_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Documentation
- Test files for validation
