# Insights Management Scripts

## üéØ **PROBLEM SOLVED**
Your RAG system was generating too many insights (up to 51 per document!). These scripts fix that by implementing strict limits and cleaning up existing over-generated insights.

## üìÅ **ORGANIZED STRUCTURE**

## üöÄ **HOW TO RUN**

### **Step 1: Navigate to Project**
```bash
cd /Users/meganharrison/Documents/github/ai-agent-mastery3/6_Agent_Deployment/backend_rag_pipeline
```

### **Step 2: Clean Up Existing Mess**
```bash
python scripts/cleanup_insights.py
```
**What it does:**
- Finds your 979 insights across 259 documents
- Identifies documents with >5 insights (like that one with 51!)
- Keeps only the top 5 per document (by quality score)
- Deletes the rest (~400-500 low-quality ones)

### **Step 3: Test New Limits Work**
```bash
python scripts/test_insight_limits.py
```
**What it does:**
- Tests a very detailed document that would generate 20+ insights with old system
- Verifies new system generates only 2-5 high-quality insights
- Shows you the quality difference

### **Step 4: Test Single Document**
```bash
python scripts/test_single_document.py
```
**What it does:**
- Processes one sample meeting document
- Shows exactly what insights the AI extracts
- Verifies meeting dates are working

## üìä **WHAT YOU'LL GET**

### **BEFORE (Your Current Data):**
```
"2023-10-10 - UB Dallas Schedule Review" ‚Üí 51 insights! üò±
Including routine ones like:
‚Ä¢ "Meeting discussed timeline"
‚Ä¢ "Attendees reviewed agenda"  
‚Ä¢ "Team mentioned concerns"
‚Ä¢ ... 48 more routine insights
```

### **AFTER (Cleaned Up):**
```
"2023-10-10 - UB Dallas Schedule Review" ‚Üí 5 insights ‚úÖ
Only business-critical ones like:
‚Ä¢ "Critical Budget Overrun - $50K Above Projections"
‚Ä¢ "Timeline Delay Risk - Project Behind by 3 Weeks"
‚Ä¢ "Key Stakeholder Departure - Immediate Action Required"
‚Ä¢ "Compliance Deadline - October 31st Critical"
‚Ä¢ "Resource Shortage - 2 Additional Staff Needed"
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **REQUIREMENTS**
```bash
pip install supabase python-dotenv openai
```

## üéØ **SUCCESS METRICS**
- **Before:** 979 insights (average 3.8 per doc, max 51 per doc)
- **After:** ~500-600 insights (max 5 per doc, high-quality only)
- **Result:** RAG system becomes actually useful instead of overwhelming

## üîß **TROUBLESHOOTING**

### **Missing Dependencies:**
```bash
pip install supabase python-dotenv openai
```

### **Environment Variables Not Found:**
Check your `.env` file has:
- `SUPABASE_URL`
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY` 
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`

### **Database Connection Issues:**
1. Verify you ran the SQL to add `document_date` column
2. Check Supabase permissions
3. Ensure OpenAI has available credits

## üéâ **EXPECTED OUTCOME**
- ‚úÖ Much cleaner, focused insights
- ‚úÖ RAG recommendations become actually useful
- ‚úÖ Users will read insights instead of ignoring them
- ‚úÖ Meeting dates work for time-based prioritization

**Run the cleanup script first to fix your existing mess!**
